# Ticket To Ride
This repository is a fun experiment trying to roughly recreate the popular board game "Ticket to Ride" within C++. In the
near future this repository will (hopefully) become a fully working command-line based game. I look to extend it to a full
graphical user interface in time, or maybe I will use TensorFlow and reinforcement learning to try and use machine learning
to optimise game strategy. Either way stay tuned - it should be interesting.

## To Build
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a "build" directory ideally in the same directory as "src" and cd into it
3. Run "cmake ../src" (you should have CMake >= 3.2 installed)
4. Run "make" when inside the src directory. 
5. The output executable should be found in the build directory with name ticket-to-ride
